Here I will write all the tasks I have to do one by one and complete them as and when I get time.

# Tasks to do:

- [ ] Make a pipeline to georeference Mars datasets.
  - [ ] Setup a custom projection of the Mars surface. 

- [ ] Make a feature that segments the colorised terrain map given a start and end point on the mars surface given the coordinates. Put failchecks and warnings. This would involve clipping a segment of the MOPA dataset or joining whole or parts of two or more segments.
- [ ] List down all the spatial methods used in this process.
- [ ] Make a DEM / DTM / TIN from the colorised data. Either use image processing techniques or use QGIS if there is a function of the same. I will go with QGIS if it is easier there.
- [ ] Fit visualisation of the DEM / DTM in the pipeline.

This should be enough for the mid-submission, given that I document all the things I do.
