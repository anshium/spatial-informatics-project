# Coordinate System on Mars

## Longitude and Latitue on Mars

Similar to Earth:

### Latitude
- Equator: 0 degree
- Poles: +/- 90 degrees

### Longitude
- Measured eastward.
- Prime meridian runs through a crater called Airy-0
- Runs from [0 to 360 E)
  
### Reference Systems and Elevation (Altitude)
- "Datum" (or reference level) for altitude is based on Mars' aeroid, an imaginary surface of constant gravitational potential roughly analogous to the sea level on Earth.
- The most commonly used elevation datum for Mars is based on an areoid defined by gravitational measurements from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission.
  
### Map projections and spatial grids
- Global maps of Mars use projections such as the cylindrical equidistant projection.
- Mercator projection is used on Earth.
- The projection for Mars is without distortions at the poles, given Mars' lack of oceans.
